; using the lambda calculus definition of addition of m and n:
; "Because the m-th composition of f composed with the n-th composition of f gives the m+n-th composition of f, addition can be defined as follows:
; PLUS := 位m.位n.位f.位x.m f (n f x)"
; (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Arithmetic_in_lambda_calculus)

(define (+ m n)
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x)
      ((m f) ((n f) x)) )))
